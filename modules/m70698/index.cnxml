<section id="fs-idm380233488"><title>Encoding and Decoding</title>
<para id="fs-idm361243568">Two important aspects of this model are <term>encoding</term> and <term>decoding</term>. Encoding is the process by which individuals initiating the communication translate their ideas into a systematic set of symbols (language), either written or spoken. Encoding is influenced by the sender’s previous experiences with the topic or issue, her emotional state at the time of the message, the importance of the message, and the people involved. Decoding is the process by which the recipient of the message interprets it. The receiver attaches meaning to the message and tries to uncover its underlying intent. Decoding is also influenced by the receiver’s previous experiences and frame of reference at the time of receiving the message.</para>

<section id="fs-idm378349136"><title>Feedback</title>
<para id="fs-idm365475936">Several types of feedback can occur after a message is sent from the communicator to the receiver. Feedback can be viewed as the last step in completing a communication episode and may take several forms, such as a verbal response, a nod of the head, a response asking for more information, or no response at all. As with the initial message, the response also involves encoding, medium, and decoding.</para>
<para id="fs-idm378224400">There are three basic types of feedback that occur in communication.<cite target-id="ch16rfin-2"><note class="reference" display="inline" id="ch16rfin-2">R. E. Quinn, S. R. Faerman, M. P. Thompson, M.R. McGrath, and D. S. Bright, <emphasis effect="italics">Becoming a Master Manager</emphasis>, Sixth edition, Wiley, 2015, Page 48.</note></cite> These are informational, corrective, and reinforcing. In informational feedback, the receiver provides nonevaluative information to the communicator. An example is the level of inventory at the end of the month. In corrective feedback, the receiver responds by challenging the original message. The receiver might respond that it is not her responsibility to monitor inventory. In reinforcing feedback, the receiver communicated that she has clearly received the message and its intentions. For instance, the grade that you receive on a term paper (either positive or negative) is reinforcing feedback on your term paper (your original communication).</para>

<section id="fs-idm365919392"><title>Noise</title>
<para id="fs-idm368373664">There is, however, a variety of ways that the intended message can get distorted. Factors that distort message clarity are <term>noise</term>. Noise can occur at any point along the model shown in <emphasis effect="bold"><link target-id="ch16fig02" document=""/></emphasis>, including the decoding process. For example, a manager might be under pressure and issue a directive, “I want this job completed today, and I don’t care what it costs,” when the manager does care what it costs.</para>
