The graphical representation plots a team performance curve based on the relationship between team effectiveness and its impact on the performance in a xy-plane. The vertical axis is labeled “Performance Impact” while the horizontal axis is labeled “Team Effectiveness.” It shows a curve in the shape of a tick mark, broken down into four fragments, each representing the performance of a team while they shift from working groups to a high-performance team. The first fragment forms a concave-down curve begins from a point labeled “Working Groups” on the vertical axis, with a decreasing slope. The second fragment forms a concave-up curve beginning from the end point of the first fragment labeled “Pseudo Teams,” with an increasing slope. The third fragment forms a concave-down curve beginning from the end point of the second fragment labeled “Potential Teams,” with an increasing slope. The fourth fragment forms another concave-down curve beginning from the end point of the third fragment labeled “Real Teams,” with an increasing slope. The endpoint of the fourth fragment is labeled “High Performing Team.” A linear dotted line is drawn from the point labeled “Working Groups” and passing through the point labeled “Potential Teams.”
