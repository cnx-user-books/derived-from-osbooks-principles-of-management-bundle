The graphical representation shows four waves of H R value creation, with each wave built on the previous platform. The vertical axis of the graph is labeled “H R Evolution,” with the bottom-half further labeled “Earlier approaches to H R M” and the upper-half labeled “H R M since approximately the year 2000.” The waves depicting the H R approaches are shown plotted along a concave-down curve, with an increasing slope. On moving from bottom to top, the waves are represented as follows: Wave 1, H R administration; wave 2, H R practices; wave 3, H R strategy; wave 4, H R outside in. Waves 1 and 2 are represented as earlier approaches to H R M while waves 3 and 4 are represented as H R M since approximately the year 2000.
