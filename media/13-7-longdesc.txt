The diagram shows the leadership style matrix divided into four quadrants numbered 1 through 4. Each quadrant lists a leadership style and the level of decision-making and directing power in that style. The horizontal axis along the matrix is labeled “Amount of Employee Participation in Decision-Making” with “Low” labeled on the extreme left and “High” labeled on the extreme right. The vertical axis is labeled “Amount of Leader Direction” with “High” labeled at the top and “Low” labeled at the bottom. The quadrants in the matrix read as follows. (1) Directive Autocrat: High leader decision-making power; High leader directing power. (2) Permissive Autocrat: High leader decision-making power; Low leader directing power. (3) Directive Autocrat: Low leader decision-making power; High leader directing power. (4) Permissive Autocrat: Low leader decision-making power; Low leader directing power. The diagram indicates that “Directive Autocrat” with high decision-making power and directing power involves a high amount of leader direction and low amount of employee participation in decision-making. “Permissive Autocrat” with high decision-making power and low directing power involves a low amount of leader direction and low amount of employee participation in decision-making. “Directive Autocrat” with low decision-making power and high directing power involves a high amount of leader direction and high amount of employee participation in decision-making. “Permissive Autocrat” with low decision-making power and low directing power involves a low amount of leader direction and high amount of employee participation in decision-making.
