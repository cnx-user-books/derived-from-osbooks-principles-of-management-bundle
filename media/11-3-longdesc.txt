The diagram illustrates the framework of the Total Rewards Model superimposed on the map of the world. The model is shown involving the integration of the key elements that attract, motivate, and retain employees to achieve desired business results. It shows two circles drawn one inside the other, with the large circle consisting of the elements, “Organizational culture,” “Business strategy,” and “Human Resource Strategy.” The small circle shows the total rewards model made up of “compensation,” “benefits,” “work-life,” “performance and recognition,” and “development and career opportunities.” An arrow with a text “Attract, motivate, retain” is shown starting from these circles to point at four factors namely, “employee,” “satisfaction and engagement,” “business,” and “performance and results.” A double-headed arrow is shown connecting the elements employee and satisfaction and engagement with the elements business and performance and results.
