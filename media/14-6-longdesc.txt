The illustration shows a pyramid representing Maslowâ€™s proposed hierarchy of needs. From the bottom of the hierarchy upward, the needs are: safety and security; physiological and survival; social; ego and esteem; self-actualization. Once needs lower down in the hierarchy is satisfied, needs higher up are energized.
