The diagram shows Kotter’s Change Model involving eight phases, segmented and illustrated along a downward arrow. On moving from top to bottom, the phases numbered from 1 through 8 are labeled as follows: “Establish a sense of urgency,” “Form a powerful guiding coalition,” “Create a vision of change,” “Communicate the vision,” “Remove any obstacles,” “Create small wins,” “Consolidate improvements,” and “Anchor the change.” The diagram shows the first three phases as one group, the next three phases as another group, and the last two phases as one more group.
