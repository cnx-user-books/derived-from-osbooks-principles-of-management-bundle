The flowchart shows the development of modern behavioral learning theory from “Classical Conditioning” to “Social Learning Theory” through “Thorndike’s Law of Effect” and “Operant Conditioning.” It depicts the primary objective fulfilled by each learning theory as follows. Classical conditioning emphasized observable behavior and environmental determinants behavior. Thorndike’s law of effect focused on how environmental consequences can either strengthen or weaken behaviors. Operant conditioning showed how operant behavior can be influenced by environmental cues and consequences. Social learning theory stresses self-control and vicarious learning in reciprocal relationships between person, behavior, and environment.
