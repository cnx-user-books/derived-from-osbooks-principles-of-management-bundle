The diagram shows the leadership process shaped by four components: the “Leader,” the “Followers,” the “Context,” and the “Consequence (example, suspicion, trust, dislike, affection).” It shows how the leader, the followers, and the context relate to each other and combine together to affect the final consequence, depicted by a collection of arrows, all pointing at the consequence. The arrows are further directed toward the overall leadership process implying that they all contribute to the process. It also shows the consequence responding back to affect the leader, the followers, and the context, depicted by arrows. Each component is also shown connected to the other by arrows indicating that they are all interdependent.
