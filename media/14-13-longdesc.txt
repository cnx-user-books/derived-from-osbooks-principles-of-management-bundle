The illustration depicts the expectancy theory of motivation, grouped under three components, effort-performance expectancy, performance-outcome expectancy, and valence of outcome (V sub 0). The three components are denoted by “E rightward arrow P” or “E 1,” “P rightward arrow O” or “E 2,” and “V,” respectively. In effort-performance expectancy, a certain “effort” results in a certain level of “performance” and in performance-outcome expectancy, a certain level of performance gives three valences of outcomes. The three valences of outcomes is a result of three performance-outcome expectancies, E 2 sub a, E 2 sub b, and E 2 sub c, which are “Outcome A (V sub a),” “Outcome B (V sub b),” and “Outcome C (V sub c),” respectively.
