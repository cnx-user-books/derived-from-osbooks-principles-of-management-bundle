The diagram illustrates a possible strategic path for the Walt Disney Company starting from vision to objective, depicted on a rightward arrow. It shows three phases, “Vision,” “Mission,” and “Objective” involving different strategies. The vision helps in knowing “Why do we exist” and the response to the question is “Make people happy.” The mission helps in knowing “How do we do that?” and the response to the question is “Offer quality entertainment.” The objective helps in knowing “What will we do?” and the response to the question is “Release three movies this year.”
