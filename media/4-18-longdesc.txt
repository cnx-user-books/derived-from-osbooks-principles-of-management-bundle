The diagram illustrates the integration of internal or organizational dimensions and how these work in practice to align with the external environment. It shows that the president and other officers of the organization scan the “external environment” using the SWOT analysis to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats and the “internal environment” using leadership skills, expertise, and performance history. These analyses result in the formation of “Strategy,” which involves defining the “Vision and mission values” and the “Operational goals, strategies, and competitive advantages.” Once the goals and strategies are developed, other elements are introduced under the heading “Organization.” These elements include “Structural type,” “Effectiveness versus efficiency,” “Information and control systems,” “Production,” “Human resource policies,” “Organization culture,” and “Alliances.” It further involves determining the factors that contribute to “Effectiveness outcomes” namely “Financial and economic,” “Social,” “Political,” and “Ethical.” These factors are linked with the internal environment, indicating that they affect the internal environment.
