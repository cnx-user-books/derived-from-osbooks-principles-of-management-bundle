This line depicts the seller's asking price and ranges from $0 to $300,000, with $300,000 marked as the asking price. At almost center of this line, seller's resistance price is labelled. Below this line is another line marked Buyer's offer price. At the almost center of this line is a tick mark labelled offer price with a rightward running arrow marked Buyer's resistance price (maximum offer). A dashed rectangle is drawn on these lines. This rectangle is depicted as the bargaining zone.
