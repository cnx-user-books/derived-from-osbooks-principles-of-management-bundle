The diagram illustrates the evolution of six types of organizational structures as a continuum, starting from mechanistic systems to organic systems. It shows the period of time divided into three phases as follows: “Era 1, mid-1800s to late 1970s,” “Era 2, 1960s to 1980s,” and “Era 3, mid-1990s to present.” On moving from the left of the continuum, the structures are numbered from 1 through 6 as follows: “Functional Structure,” “Divisional Structure,” “Geographic Structure,” “Matrix Structure,” “Vertical Team Structure,” and “Virtual Structure.” The first two forms of structures evolved during the first era, the next two forms during the second era, and the last two forms during the third era.
