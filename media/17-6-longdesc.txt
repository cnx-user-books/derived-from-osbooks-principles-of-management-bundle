The first stage “Plan” is marked at the top, the second stage “Do” is marked on the right, the third stage “Check” is marked at the bottom, and the fourth stage “Act” is marked on the left. The cycle is featured with an arrow labeled “1” indicating from the first stage to the second stage, an arrow labeled “2” indicating from the second stage to the third stage, an arrow labeled “3” indicating from the third stage to the fourth stage, and an arrow labeled “4” indicating from the fourth stage to the first stage. It further shows three identical arrows labeled “5,” “6,” and “7” running along the arrows labeled “1,” “2,” and “3,” respectively. There is an ellipsis with the arrow labeled “7,” indicating the continuous implementation of the stages of quality improvement.
