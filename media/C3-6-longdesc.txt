The illustration shows the causes of internal and external attributions, grouped under “External Attributions” and “Internal Attributions.” In external attributions, the person’s behavior stems mainly from external causes. In internal attributions, the person’s behavior stems mainly from internal causes. The external attributions are caused due to “High Consensus,” “High Consistency,” and “High Distinctiveness.” In high consensus, others behave in the same manner in this situation. In high consistency, the person behaves in the same manner on other occasions when placed in the same situation. In high distinctiveness, the person does not behave in this manner in other situations. The internal attributions are caused due to “Low Consensus,” “High Consistency,” and “Low Distinctiveness.” In low consensus, others do not behave in the same manner in this situation. In high consistency, the person behaves in the same manner on other occasions when placed in the same situation. In low distinctiveness, the person behaves in the same manner in other situations.
