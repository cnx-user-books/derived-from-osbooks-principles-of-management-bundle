The illustration shows an employee with high aspirations and self-motivation is pushed by the company to meet company-imposed goals while frustrating the employee’s personal goals. This makes the employee experience prolonged stress, fatigue, frustration, and helplessness. As a result, the employee decreases aspiration and motivation level, loses self-confidence, and withdraws, thereby leading to job burnout.
