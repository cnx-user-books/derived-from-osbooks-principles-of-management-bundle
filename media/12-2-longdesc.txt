The graph plots the percentage distribution of the labor force for five different races. The vertical axis of the graph is labeled “Percent Distribution” ranging from 0 to 90 percent, in increments of 10. The horizontal axis of the graph is labeled “Year Projections 1994 to 2024” representing the years 1994 to 2024, in increments of 10 years. It shows five linear curves plotted on the graph denoting “White non-Hispanic,” “Black,” “Asian,” “Hispanic origin,” and “All other groups.” The percentage distribution of the labor force for each race over the years is plotted as follows. White non-Hispanic: 1994, 78; 2004, 70; 2014, 65; 2024, 60. Black: 1994, 11; 2004, 11; 2014, 12; 2024, 13. Asian: 1994, 5; 2004, 6; 2014, 7; 2024, 8. Hispanic origin: 1994, 9.5; 2004, 13; 2014, 17; 2024, 20. All other groups: 1994, Data not available; 2004, 3; 2014, 3.5; 2024, 4. All values are approximated.
