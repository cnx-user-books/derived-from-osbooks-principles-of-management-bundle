The diagram presents the SMART Framework for creating good goals. It lists five common characteristics of good goals namely, “Specific,” “Measurable,” “Achievable,” “Relevant,” and “Time-Bound.” Each characteristic is further elaborated as follows. Specific: “The goal should be specific and understandable.” Measurable: “The goal should be measurable so that you can tell if you are achieving it.” Achievable: “The goal should be achievable and reasonable, not impossible.” Relevant: “The goal should be relevant to your overall objective and help you to advance toward it.” Time-Bound: “The goal must have a time limit so that there is a sense of urgency to accomplishing it.”
