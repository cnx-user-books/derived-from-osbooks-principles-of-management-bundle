The diagram illustrates the basic incongruity between employee and organizational goals. It depicts that employees want the organization to provide meaningful work assignments, allow for flexibility and independence of behavior on the job, allow employees to develop and use their skills, and treat employees as equals, not subordinates. On the other hand, it depicts that organization want employees to follow orders, rules, and procedures, depend on the organization for rewards, and perform simple, repetitive tasks. They altogether establish a basic incongruity between employee and organizational goals. It further depicts how employees respond in various ways.
