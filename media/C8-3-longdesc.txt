The vertical axis of the graph ranges from 0 to 40, in increments of 5. The horizontal axis of the graph ranges from 1 to 7, in increments of 1. The first parabola labeled “Strictness” opens downward and passes through points at ordered pair 0.2 comma 5 and ordered pair 2.8 comma 5, with the vertex lying at ordered pair 1.5 comma 34. The second parabola labeled “Central Tendency” opens downward and passes through points at ordered pair 2.3 comma 5 and ordered pair 5 comma 5, with the vertex lying at ordered pair ordered pair 3.8 comma 34. The third parabola labeled “Leniency” opens downward and passes through points at ordered pair 4.7 comma 5 and ordered pair 7.3 comma 5, with the vertex lying at ordered pair ordered pair 6 comma 34. All values are approximated.
