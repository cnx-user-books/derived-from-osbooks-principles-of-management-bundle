The vertical axis of the graph is labeled “Change in Performance” and the horizontal axis is labeled “Level of Stress.” The vertical axis is marked with a “plus sign” at its top, “0” at its center, and a “Minus sign” at its bottom. The horizontal axis is labeled “None” at extreme left-end, “Moderate” at its center, and “High” at its right-end. The graph has a linear dashed line, drawn parallel to the horizontal axis from 0. It shows a concave downward curve rising upward with an increasing slope from a point lying in the region labeled “None,” on the dashed line. The curve reaches its peak at a point lying just before the region labeled “Moderate” from where it falls downward with a decreasing slope to the region labeled “High.”
