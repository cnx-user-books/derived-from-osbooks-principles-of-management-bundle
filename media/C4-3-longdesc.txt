The first flowchart representing “Classical Conditioning” shows “Unconditioned stimulus (food)” and “Conditioned stimulus (bell)” resulting in “Response (salivation).” The second flowchart representing “Operant Conditioning” shows “Stimulus” leading to “Reward” through “Drive X habit (S R bond)” and “Behavior.” It further shows “Strengthened S R bond” influencing both the drive X habit and the reward while the reward further influences the drive X habit through “Drive reduction.”
