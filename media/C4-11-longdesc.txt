The diagram illustrates the social learning theory model of self-management made up of four elements, “Situational Cues,” “The Person,” “Behaviors,” and “Consequences.” These elements are connected to each other by double-headed arrows indicating that they are related to each other. The sub-elements of each element are further listed as follows. Situational cues: “Personal goal setting,” “Self-contracts,” “Attention focusers,” “Self-observation data,” “Avoidance of negative cues,” and “Seeking positive cues.” The person: “Symbolic coding,” “Rehearsal,” and “Self-talk.” Behaviors: “Performing unappealing but necessary tasks.” Consequences: “Self-reinforcement” and “Self-punishment.”
