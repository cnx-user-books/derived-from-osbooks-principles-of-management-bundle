The diagram illustrates four types of general macro environments and forces that affect the performance of organizations: “Economic Forces,” “Technological Forces,” “Sociocultural Forces,” “Natural Disasters and Human-Induced Problems,” and “Government and Political Forces.” These forces are shown presented inside text boxes, with arrows drawn from each text box pointing at a circle labeled “The Organization,” indicating that they collectively affect the functioning of the organizations. Each force is further divided into its sub-components as follows. Economic forces: “Globalization,” “Competitors and supply chain,” “Currency exchange rates,” “Employment and wage rates,” and “Lending policies of financial institutions.” Technological forces: “Information technology and the Internet,” “New production forces,” and “How technology is sold and serviced.” Sociocultural forces: “Demographic trends,” “Lifestyle changes,” “Availability skills,” “Attitudes toward work,” “Gender issues,” “Willingness to move,” and “Ethics.” Natural disasters and human-induced problems: “Weather,” “Extreme storms (hurricanes, tsunamis, volcanos, earthquakes),” “Pollution,” and “Health, food, stress.” Government and political forces: “Government legislation,” “International law,” “Wars,” “Local regulations,” “Taxation,” and “Trade union activities.”
