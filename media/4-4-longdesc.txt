The diagram illustrating the environment-industry-organization fit is shown divided into four quadrants. On starting from the upper-left quadrant, the quadrants are depicted as follows. “Simple plus Stable equals 1,” Low Uncertainty: It is influenced by a small number of external elements and the elements are similar. The elements remain the same or change slowly. Examples include soft drink bottlers, container manufacturers, and food processors. “Complex plus Stable equals 2,” Low to Moderate Uncertainty: It is influenced by a large number of external elements and the elements are dissimilar. The elements remain the same or change slowly. Examples include universities, appliance manufacturers, chemical companies, and insurance companies. “Simple plus Unstable equals 3,” High to Moderate Uncertainty: It is influenced by a small number of external elements and the elements are similar. The elements change frequently and unpredictably. Examples include e-commerce, fashion clothing, music industry, and toy manufacturers. “Complex plus Unstable equals 4”: It is influenced by a large number of external elements and the elements are dissimilar. The elements change frequently and unpredictably. Examples include computer firms, aerospace, telecommunications, and airlines. An arrow labeled “Uncertainty” is shown starting from the quadrant labeled “Simple plus Stable equals 1, Low Uncertainty” and pointing at the quadrant labeled “Complex plus Unstable equals 4.”
