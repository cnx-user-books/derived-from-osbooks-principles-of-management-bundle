The diagram illustrates the continuum of leadership behavior as a range of activities related to the degree of authority used by the manager (depicted on the left) and to the area of freedom available to subordinates (depicted on the right) in arriving at decisions. A broad range of leadership styles has been depicted on the continuum between two extremes of autocratic and free rein. The left side shows a style labeled “Boss-Centered Leadership” while the right side shows a style labeled “Subordinate-Centered Leadership.” A text at the extreme left of the diagram reads “Autocratic leader is dominant in making decisions” and a text at the extreme right reads “Free rein-followers are free to choose; leader becomes passive,” indicating that on moving from left to right, authority moves from manager-oriented decision making to subordinate oriented decision making. It further shows seven styles placed on the continuum, from left to right as follows: Manager makes decision and announces it; Manager “sells” decision; Manager presents ideas and invites questions; Manager presents tentative decision subject to change; Manager presents problem, gets suggestions, makes decision; Manager defines limits, asks group to make decision; Manager permits subordinates to function within limits defined by superior. A scale appears at the bottom of the continuum measuring the level of participation, with the styles toward the left of the continuum labeled “Low” and the styles toward the right labeled “High.”
