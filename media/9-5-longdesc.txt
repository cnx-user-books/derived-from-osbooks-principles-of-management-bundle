The diagram outlines a set of questions that three different strategic analysis tools, “PESTEL,” “Porter’s 5 Forces,” and “Resources and Capabilities” can answer. The questions that PESTEL can answer are as follows. “What technological opportunities exist for my business?” “What sociocultural trends provide opportunities for my business?” and “Are there laws or regulations that affect what I can sell or how I can make my product?” The questions that Porter’s 5 Forces can answer are as follows. “Are other firms in the industry competing based on price or on differentiation?” “Are new firms coming into this market?” “Do buyers have attractive substitute options for my offerings?” and “Are suppliers available for the supplies I need?” The questions that Resources and Capabilities can answer are as follows. “Do we have any special resources or capabilities that our competitors don’t?” and “Do we need any resources or capabilities in order to compete with other firms in the industry?”
