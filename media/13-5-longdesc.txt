The diagram shows three text boxes connected to each other by rightward arrows. The first text box titled “Leader” reads, “Influence and power tactic (example, use of rationality).” The second text box titled “Follower Compliance” lists four components namely, “Alienation and resistance,” “Calculative compliance,” “Identification,” and “Internalization.” Another factor, “Commitment” is further shown as a sub-component of “Internalization.” The third text box titled “Group Effectiveness” lists three components namely, “Follower satisfaction,” “Follower motivation,” and “Follower performance.” A text at the bottom further reads, “Effective leadership is more likely to occur when the leader’s influence flows out of rationality, expertise, moralistic appeal, and/or referent power.”
