The diagram of the decision tree illustrates the process of ethical decision-making by listing the possible actions while deciding whether a particular activity is legal or not. If the activity is legal, one must further consider whether it maximizes shareholder value or not. If the activity is not legal, it must not be done. If the activity maximizes shareholder value, the decision maker must further analyze if it is ethical or not. If it is ethical, then it must be done. However, if the action is not ethical it must not be done. The decision maker must also analyze if it would be ethical to take action when the activity does not maximize shareholder value. If it is ethical, then it must not be done. If it is not ethical, it must be done, but the actions must be disclosed to the shareholders.
