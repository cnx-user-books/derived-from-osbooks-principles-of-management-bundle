The diagram illustrates the networked team structure in an organization. It shows different forms of team structures networked together. It shows “ARGEE Members” participating in “European Projects,” consisting of smaller groups labeled, “E A P,” “E O P,” “D I P,” “S U,” and “S U C T,” with a “Coordinator” acting as a communicator between “S U” and “S U C T.” Their members are further shown participating in the activities of “Interest Groups” made up of smaller groups labeled “L I G” and “H 4 Y.” They also participate in “Network Meetings” and in the activities of “Working Groups” including, “Youth Employment,” “Spreading Europtomism,” “Youth mobility,” and “Civic Education.” Another team labeled “Academy” is shown to “train” the ARGEE members. The diagram shows another group of “ARGEE Locals” responding to “AGORA General Assembly” and sending delegates and envoys to “AGORA General Assembly,” “Chair,” and “E P M.” It also organizes “Network Meetings” intended for their members. The members of the “AGORA General Assembly” and another group “Comite Directeur” are shown involved in electing members for each other. The diagram further shows two more networks, one for “Committees” and the other for “Commissions.” The “Committees” are shown as a network of  “Liaison Officers,” “E Q A C,” “A C T,” “C I R C,” “P R C,” “I T C,” and “H R C” collectively working together. The “Commissions” are shown as a network of “J C,” “NETCOM,” “AUDIT,” and “MEDCOM” collectively working together.
