The diagram illustrates the open system model used by an organization, in three phases “Inputs,” “Throughputs,” and “Outputs.” First phase shows the organization taking in resources, raw materials, technologies, ideas, people, students, etc. from the “environment” at the input phase. Second phase shows organizational subsystems and processes transform these inputs through education, manufacturing processes, etc. at the throughput phase. Third phase shows results obtained from the throughputs phase produce products, services, trained, certified, and degreed professionals and people at the output phase. Each phase is shown connected to the other by double-headed arrows, indicating that the model acts as a loop continually taking in resources form the environment, transforming them into outputs, and returning to the environment.
