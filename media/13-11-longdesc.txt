It shows leadership behaviors and situational forces leading to a particular outcome. The factors are further categorized into their sub-factors as follows. Leader Behavior: “Supportive,” “Directive,” “Participative,” and “Achievement-oriented.” Situational Forces: “Work environment” and “Subordinate characteristics.” Both the factors and their sub-factors are collectively labeled “Combine to Influence” indicating that they all work together to result in “Subordinate Outcomes.” “Subordinate Outcomes” also comes with a list of factors namely, “Motivation,” “Satisfaction,” and “Performance.”
