The diagram shows the basic model of social learning as a triangular representation. It shows three interrelated factors influencing social learning labeled on the vertices of the triangle as 'Person', 'Environment', and 'Behavior'. The relationship between person and environment is marked with a text that reads “Self-Control: People control their own behavior to the extent that they rely on cognitive supports and manage relevant environmental cues and consequences.” The relationship between environment and behavior is marked with a text that reads “Vicarious Learning: Most complex behavior is acquired by directly observing and initiating others in a social environment.” The relationship between behavior and person is marked with a text that reads “Symbolic Processes: Symbolic verbal or mental representations of reality help guide behavior.”
