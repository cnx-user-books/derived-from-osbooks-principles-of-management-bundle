The illustration shows four dashed lines drawn parallel to each other, with the line at the top labeled “Person A’s power over B” and the line at the bottom labeled “Person B’s counterpower over A.” It also shows a linear diagonal line labeled “Person B’s response to A’s influence” drawn from the bottom-left corner to the top-right corner. The four possible responses from person B to person A’s influence are marked from bottom to top as “Ignore A,” “Fight A,” “Bargain with A,” and “Comply with A.”
