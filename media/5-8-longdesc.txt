The map shows the lists of stakeholders marked around a label, “Firm” as follows: “Owners,” “Financial Community,” “Activist Groups,” “Customers,” “Customer Advocate Group,” “Unions,” “Employees,” “Trade Associations,” “Competitions,” “Suppliers,” “Government,” and “Political Groups.” There are twelve sets of two-way arrows drawn between the label, “Firm” and the stakeholders, to depict the relationship of mutual benefit between them.
