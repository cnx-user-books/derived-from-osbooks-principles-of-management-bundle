The graphical representation illustrates the four stages of Tuckman’s model of team development by plotting the relationship between task and relationship focus in a xy-plane. The vertical axis is labeled “Task Focus” while the horizontal axis is labeled “Relationship Focus.” It shows a curve in the shape of a tick mark, broken down into four fragments, each representing a stage in team development. The first fragment forms a concave-down curve denoting the first stage “Forming,” beginning from a point lying close to the vertical axis on the plane with a decreasing slope. The second fragment forms a concave-up curve denoting the second stage “Storming,” beginning from the end point of the first fragment with an increasing slope. The third fragment forms a concave-down curve denoting the third stage “Norming,” beginning from the end point of the second fragment with an increasing slope. The fourth fragment forms another concave-down curve denoting the fourth stage “Performing,” beginning from the end point of the third fragment with an increasing slope.
