The diagram begins with an opening text to define organizational skills. The text reads as follows: “A good constructional order of material slides smoothly from one topic to another; design of course optimizes interest; students can easily follow organizational strategy; course outline is followed.” It further illustrates the anchored scale for rating college professors ranging from 1 to 10, in increments of 1. The ratings between 1 and 3 are together labeled as “Makes no use of a course syllabus; lectures on topics randomly with no longer order.” The value 1.8 on the scale is further labeled “This instructor could be expected to lecture a good deal of the time about subjects other than the subjects she is supposed to lecture on.” The ratings between 4 and 7 are together labeled as “Prepares a course syllabus but follows it only occasionally; presents lectures in no particular order, although does tie them together.” The value 4.2 on the scale is further labeled “This instructor could be expected to be sidetracked at least once a week in lecture and not to cover the intended material.” The value 6.5 on the scale is labeled “This instructor could be expected to announce at the end of each lecture the material that will be covered during the next class period.” The ratings between 8 and 10 are together labeled as “Follows course syllabus; presents lectures in a logical order; ties each lecture into the previous one.” The value 9 on the scale is further labeled “This instructor could be expected to assimilate the previous lecture into the present one before beginning the lecture.”
