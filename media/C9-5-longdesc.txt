The pair of cards used in Asch’s experiment are shown placed next to each other. The card on the left shows a vertically drawn reference line labeled “X.” The card on the right shows three comparison lines, drawn vertically one beside the other. The first line labeled “A” is of medium length, the second line labeled “B” is the shortest, while the third line labeled “C” is the longest.
