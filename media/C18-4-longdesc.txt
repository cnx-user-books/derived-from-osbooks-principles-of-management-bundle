The illustration shows the graph with the vertical axis denoting “Performance” and the horizontal axis denoting “Optimal performance.” The vertical axis is labeled “High” at its top and “Low” at its bottom. The horizontal axis is labeled “Underload” at its extreme left-end and “Overload” at its extreme right-end. The graph has a bell-shaped curve, which begins to rise upward from the origin point to a point at the center of the graph and then falls toward the end of the horizontal axis. The region of the graph lying under the peak is shaded and labeled “Optimal stress.” The consequences of underload are depicted as “Boredom,” “Decrease in motivation,” “Absenteeism,” and “Apathy.” The consequences of optimal performance are depicted as “High motivation,” “High energy,” “Sharp perception,” and “Calmness.” The consequences of overload are depicted as “Insomnia,” “Irritability,” “Increased errors,” “Indecisiveness.”
