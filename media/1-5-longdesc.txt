The illustration shows a pyramid representing differences in managerial activities by hierarchical level. From the bottom of the hierarchy upward, the levels are: rank-and-file employees; first-line management; middle management; and executive management. A speech box lies on the left of the pyramid, pointing between the 'middle management' and 'first-line management.' The text within this speech box reads, "Employees at the middle and first-line level of management might also have managerial responsibilities that span departments as the leader of a team."
