The graph shows the vertical axis denoting the level of uncertain and complex situation with its top labeled “High” and bottom labeled “Low.” The horizontal axis is denoting the complexity and uncertainty, with its left-end labeled “Low” and right-end labeled “High.” It shows the probability of political behavior as medium when the level of uncertain and complex situation is high and the competition among employees is low. The probability of political behavior is high when the level of uncertain and complex situation is high and the competition among employees is also high. The probability of political behavior is low when both the level of uncertain and complex situation and the competition among employees are low. The probability of political behavior is medium when the level of uncertain and complex situation is low and the competition among employees is high.
