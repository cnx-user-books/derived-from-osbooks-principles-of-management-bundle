The diagram shows the comparison between Kotter’s Change Model and Lewin’s Change Model, depicted as “Kotter’s Model versus Lewin’s Model.” It shows Kotter’s model divided into eight phases as follows: “Establish a sense of urgency,” “Form a powerful guiding coalition,” “Create a vision of change,” “Communicate the vision,” “Remove any obstacles,” “Create small wins,” “Consolidate improvements,” and “Anchor the change.” It further shows Lewin’s model divided into three phases namely, “Unfreeze,” “Move,” and “Refreeze.” The steps followed in each phase are as follows. Unfreeze: Examine status quo; Increase driving forces for change; Decrease resisting forces against. Move: Take action; Make changes; Involve people. Refreeze: Make change permanent; Establish new way of things; Reward desired outcomes. The diagram compares the first three phases of Kotter’s model with Lewin’s first phase. The next three phases of Kotter’s model are compared with the second phase of Lewin’s model. The last two phases of Kotter’s model are compared with the third phase of Lewin’s model.
