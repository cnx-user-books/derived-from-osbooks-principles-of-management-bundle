The diagram shows the strategies divided into “Stimulus,” “Work Behavior,” “Possible Supervisory Actions,” and “Behavioral Change Strategy.” The strategy in stimulus involves “supervisor’s request to avoid tardiness.” It results in two strategies, “Employee is consistently on time” and “Employee is consistently late” under work behavior. The strategy “employee is consistently on time” results in two possible supervisory actions labeled as “Praise employees and recommend merit pay increases” and “Avoid harassing or reprimanding employees.” The strategy “employee is consistently late” further results in two possible supervisory actions labeled as “Withhold praise and do not recommend merit pay increases” and “Reprimand and harass employees.” Four strategies are listed under behavioral change strategy as “Positive reinforcement,” “Avoidance learning,” “Extinction,” and “Punishment.”
