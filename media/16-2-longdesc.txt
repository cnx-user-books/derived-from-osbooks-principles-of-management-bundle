The basic model of communication shows the continuous flow of information between the communicator and the receiver in a linear sequence. The communicator encodes the message using context that would affect the receiver and transmits it to the receiver through a medium. The receiver attaches meaning to it and tries to uncover its underlying intent. Once the message is decoded, the receiver provides feedback to the communicator and takes it into effect. The noise remains present throughout the process of communication from encoding to decoding.
