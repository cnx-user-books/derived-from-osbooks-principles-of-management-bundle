The diagram illustrates the strategic contingencies model of subunit power under seven conditions. The conditions are represented from top to bottom as follows: “A forestalls uncertainty for B,” “A provides information to B,” “A absorbs pressures on B,” “A is only source of B’s inputs,” “A’s personnel are irreplaceable,” “A’s workflow is pervasive,” and “A’s workflow is needed urgently.” The first three conditions are together labeled as “A can help B cope with uncertainty.” The next two conditions are together labeled as “A’s contributions have no or few substitutes.” The last two conditions are together labeled as “A’s contribution are central to organizational success.” The three strategies are together labeled as “Amount of subunit power of A over B.”
