The flow chart diagram shows the four stages involved in model of the conflict process, namely frustration, conceptualization, behavior, and outcome. The diagram depicts two Episodes. Episodes start with first stage of "Frustration". It then proceeds to second stage of "conceptualization", which further leads to the third stage of behavior. Final stage in both the episodes is "outcome". Other's reactions play a role in achieving these results. In episode 1 other's reaction doesn't let behavior lead to outcome, whereas in episode 2 behavior leads to outcome despite other's reaction.
