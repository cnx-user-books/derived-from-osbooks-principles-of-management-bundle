The graphical representation shows the managerial grid developed by Blake and Mouton, with five different leadership styles, based on the concern for people and the concern for production. The vertical axis is labeled “Concern for People” ranging from 1 (marked as low) to 9 (marked as high), in increments of 1 and the horizontal axis is labeled “Concern for Production” ranging from 1 (marked as low) to 9 (marked as high), in increments of 1. The resulting styles of leadership presented on the graph are as follows.
First: Indifferent (Evade and Elude), plotted at ordered pair 1 comma 1, reads “I distance myself from taking active responsibility for results to avoid getting entangled in problems. If forced, I take a passive or supportive decision.”
Second: Accommodating (Yield and Comply), plotted at ordered pair 1 comma 9, reads “I support results that establish and reinforce harmony. I generate enthusiasm by focusing on positive and pleasing aspects of work.”
Third: Status Quo (Balance and Compromise) plotted at ordered pair 5 comma 5, reads “I endorse results that are popular but caution against taking unnecessary risk. I test my opinions with others involved to assure ongoing acceptability.”
Fourth: Controlling (Direct and Dominate) plotted at ordered pair 9 comma 1, reads “I expect results and take control by clearly stating a course of action. I enforce rules that sustain high results and do not permit deviation.”
Fifth: Sound (Contribute and Commit) plotted at ordered pair 9 comma 9, reads “I support team action in a way that invites involvement and commitment. I explore all facts and alternative views to reach a shared understanding of the best solution.”
