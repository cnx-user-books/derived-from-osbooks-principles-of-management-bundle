The diagram illustrates the B C G Matrix divided into four quadrants on a xy-plane. The x-axis is labeled “Market Share” with its left part depicting “low” market share and right part depicting “high” market share. The y-axis is labeled “Market Growth” with its lower part depicting “low” market growth and upper part depicting “high” market growth. The four categories presented in the quadrants are “Star,” “Question Mark,” “Dog,” and “Cash Cow.” Each category is further described as follows. Star: These business units have high market share in a high-growth market. They are generating revenue, but the C E O should invest to keep growing market share. Question Mark: These business units are not doing well in a high-growth market and the C E O will need to decide to invest or scrap the business. Dog: These business units are doing poorly in a low-growth market and should be divested. Cash Cow: These business units have high market share in a market that isn’t growing. C E Os should use the money they earn to invest in the Stars.
