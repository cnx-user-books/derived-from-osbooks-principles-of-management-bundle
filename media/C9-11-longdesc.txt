The diagram illustrates “Pooled interdependence,” “Sequential interdependence,” and “Reciprocal interdependence” as the different types of group interdependences. Under pooled interdependence, two inputs “Consumer products division” and “Industrial products division” are shown sent to “Packing and Shipping Department” that results in “Outputs.” Under sequential interdependence, the inputs are shown sent to the “Purchasing Department,” “Marketing Department,” and “Packing and Shipping Department” that results in “Outputs.” Under reciprocal interdependence, the inputs are shown flowing from “Product Engineering Department” to “Quality Assurance Department” and then from “Quality Assurance Department” to “Product Engineering Department” finally resulting in “Outputs.”
