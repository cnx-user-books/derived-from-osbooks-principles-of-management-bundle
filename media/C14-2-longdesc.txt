The relationship between conflict intensity and outcomes is plotted on a graph as a curve. The horizontal axis is marked Intensity and ranges from low to moderate to high. The vertical axis is marked Outcomes and ranges from Negative to neutral to Positive. The curves suggest that too much and too little conflict can lead to negative outcomes and a moderate amount of conflict will lead to neutral or positive outcomes.
