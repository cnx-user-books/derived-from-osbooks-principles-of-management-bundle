The diagram illustrates two types of organizational structures, one labeled “Mechanistic” and the other labeled “Organic.” The mechanistic structure of organization features a stable and low uncertainty environment. Its other characteristics are listed as follows: “Top-down hierarchy,” “Narrow span of control,” “Specialized tasks,” “Formal rules,” “Vertical communication,” and “Structured decision-making.” The organic structure of organization features an unstable and high uncertainty environment. Its other characteristics are listed as follows: “Less rigid, horizontal organization,” “Flexible, few rules,” “Two-way communication,” “Participatory decision-making,” “Generalized shared tasks,” and “Wide span of control.”
