The diagram illustrates various factors influencing intergroup behavior and performance. The three main factors are labeled as, “Degree of required group interdependence,” “Extent of task uncertainty,” and “Groups’ time and goal orientation.” These result in the following bases for interaction: “Interdependence requirements,” “Information flow requirements,” and “Integration requirements.” The bases are shown further pointing toward two overlapping circles, with the common region labeled “Intergroup Behavior and performance” and the non-overlapping region labeled as “Group Number 1” and “Group Number 2,” respectively. The elements listed under group 1 are as follows: “Norms,” “Roles,” “Status,” “Size,” and “Cohesiveness.” The elements listed under group 2 are as follows: “Norms,” “Roles,” “Status,” “Size,” and “Cohesiveness.” The diagram further shows a list of elements under “Organizational context” pointing toward the circles. These elements are listed as follows: “Rules and procedures,” “Corporate culture,” “Goals and reward systems,” and “Decision-making process.”
