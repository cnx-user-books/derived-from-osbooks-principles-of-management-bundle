The diagram illustrates a square with its vertices labeled with strategic and operational questions. The questions on each vertex read as follows: First, “What business are we in?” Second, “Who is our customer?” Third, “What are our core competencies?” Fourth, “What is our product or service?” The region inside the square shows three elements, “Vision,” “Mission,” and “Values.” “Vision” provides answers to questions like “Who are we?” and “Who will we become?” “Mission” provides answers to questions like “What is our strategic purpose for operating?” “Values” provides answers to the questions like “What do we stand for and believe in?” and “What standards can be used to evaluate and judge us?”
